# Lab-Assistant

## Project Goal
Lab assistant tool that uses a large dataset of laboratory data and research papers to create a system that ensures lab practices align with established research to
verify results. It will be an acting proofreader of lab imagery to ensure work adheres to safe and practical research procedures and other work within the lab.

### Provider Choice: Google Gemini 3.0 Pro
Native multi-modality. It can process the Broad Bioimage sets and the Pes2oX text in the same context window without needing separate vision encoders like CLIP.

### Setup
Use pip install -r requirements.txt and store the GOOGLE_API_KEY in GitHub Codespace Secrets.
